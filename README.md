### 📝 Notes

* The project was bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.
* Tailwind was configured via `postcss` and `tailwind.config.js`.
* Used `mobile-first` approach with `sm`, `md`, `lg` breakpoints.
* Extra effort was taken to make the layout consistent with the grid, spacing, and typography in the Figma file.
